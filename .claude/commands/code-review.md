Review the code in the current uncommitted changes.
Rate the code from 1–10 in each of the following areas:
- Clarity – How readable, maintainable, and self-explanatory is the code?
- Correctness – How well does the code achieve its intended purpose without bugs or logical issues?
- Robustness – How well does it handle edge cases, errors, and future changes?

Provide specific, actionable suggestions for improvement, including inline edit examples for small fixes or refactors.
For larger issues, describe the recommended approach clearly but concisely.
