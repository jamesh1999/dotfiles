# General Instructions
Compare the current code with main.
Rate the code from 1–10 in each of the following areas:
- Clarity – How readable, maintainable, and self-explanatory is the code?
- Correctness – How well does the code achieve its intended purpose without bugs or logical issues?
- Robustness – How well does it handle edge cases, errors, and future changes?
- (For repos with test suites) Testing - Is new behaviour covered? Are there any quick unit tests to improve this?

Provide specific, actionable suggestions for improvement, including inline edit examples for small fixes or refactors.
For larger issues, describe the recommended approach clearly but concisely.

If there are changes in a CHANGELOG, verify that they are true to the code changes.
